Instructor Notes

Bootstrap can be found at the following path: css/bootstrap.min.css. Please use the exact path. Tests will fail if you will use a different path for bootstrap files.

Font family is "Lucida Grande", sans-serif

Font color for the main title and text is #666666, for subtitle - #F07C17

The border around the box under the image should be solid 1px and its color should be#CCCCCC.

You will have to find the font sizes, line spacing, margins/padding on your own.

Do not try to load non-local files (like fonts, from another server) in our page. This can cause the "dubious: no message left" - also there is another cause of that error we just discovered: if your line-height is a large value like 200%.
